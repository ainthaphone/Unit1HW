FinTech Case Study
# Crypto.com Case Study

## Crypto.com is a platform that offers financial services, trading, and payment. 

*Crypto.com, formerly known as Monaco it is based in Hong Kong.

*The company was incorporated in 2016 as Monaco and later rebranded as Crypto.com in 2018.

*The founders of the company are: Bobby Bao, Gary Or, Kris Marszalek and Rafael Melo.

* The company’s belief is based off basic human rights having control over one’s data, identity, and control of one’s financial assets. It was also created to expedite the world’s use in cryptocurrency.

*Crypto.com is funded by issuing loans based on collateral in cryptocurrency and is also a payment method with MCO debit cards they offer. Users of the platform can stake their CRO tokens, in return they are rewarded in the system with interest based on the amount of staked. The funding received is $63.92 million. 

## Business Activities:

*Crypto.com is blending cryptocurrency and fiat currency (government issued currency that is not backed by commodity).

*The company designed this for all levels of crypto users. Crypto.com offers many incentives to members. MCO debit cards, stake rewards, earn a certain percentage back on purchases (depending on level of stake), $50 referral, airport lounge access, no fees associated with debit card. They also have their own tokens formerly known as MCO are now CRO. However not all of Crypto.com’s services are available in certain countries. Crypto invest is a robo advisor where users may invest in various crypto and it can be traded using “quant strategies.” This strategy uses the computer to test, formulate, and strategize. Crypto invest service is not available to U.S. users due to regulations.

*The technology this company uses is a blockchain. They also use a hybrid accounting model which combines Unspent Transactions Output (UTXOs) and account-based model.

## Landscape

*Crypto.com is in the bank, investment, and market domain in relations to finance. 

*Major trend of this company is linking finance and technology together offering convenience use of a debit card to its platform users. Making it a cashless society and easier way to pay someone with just a few taps. Crypto.com is also backed by the FDIC for up to $25,000.


## Results

*Crypto.com is currently working with a few e commerce companies so merchants may accept crypto or fiat currency of their preference. They don’t have any service or product offering local merchants option to accept crypto in person. 

*Core metrics:

Staff: they have 294 staff members
Web traffic: 1.3 million
Users: 2 million users 
Revenue: CRO tokens

*Crypto.com is still new and must improve in some areas of their company, one is customer service. 

## Recommendations

*I would advise Crypto.com to come out with a product and/or services merchants can use as well. They are currently working with a few, but I feel if they had more tangible product to offer merchants to accept payment such as Square the chances of converting merchants to crypto will be much higher.

*This product and service would greatly benefit the company as they will convert merchants into taking cashless payments using crypto or funds from their fiat wallet. The business impact of using crypto is funds are deposited rather quickly. Also access to a world market without the high cost of exchange rates and fees as well as operating 24/7 without needing a bank to process. Not to mention the security as it is backed by a block chain so transactions cannot be canceled or reversed.
